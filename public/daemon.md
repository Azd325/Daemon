[ABOUT]

I'm Tim Kleinschmidt, a senior software developer based in Berlin, Germany. I enjoy building meaningful, visible features and crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. I work intuitively while maintaining clear priorities.

I'm deeply interested in Bitcoin, financial markets, and human behavior. I value deep understanding over superficial trends and am currently exploring personal knowledge management. I'm an active member of the open-source community.
